# WildIvy
 Before COVID, my sister started a side businesses selling flowers. She tasked me with building the website. I started with the front end to get a design that she was happy with and then planned to integrate a database.

Her project has been discontinued indefinitely due to the pandemic, however, not that I have finished university, I plan to see it through and create the full system
as I liked where the project was headed.
